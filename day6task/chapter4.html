<p>Rama heads outside the Kosala kingdom, crosses Yamuna river and initially stays at Chitrakuta, on the banks of river Mandakini, in the hermitage of sage Vasishtha.
     During the exile, Rama meets one of his devotee, Shabari who happened to love him so much that when Rama asked something to eat she offered her ber, a fruit. 
     But every time she gave it to him she first tasted it to ensure that it was sweet and tasty as a testament to her devotion. 
     Rama also understood her devotion and ate all the half-eaten bers given by her. Such was the reciprocation of love and compassion he had for his people.
      This place is believed in the Hindu tradition to be the same as Chitrakoot on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. 
      The region has numerous Rama temples and is an important Vaishnava pilgrimage site.
      The texts describe nearby hermitages of Vedic rishis (sages) such as Atri, and 
      that Rama roamed through forests, lived a humble simple life, provided protection and relief to ascetics in the forest being harassed and persecuted by demons, as they stayed at different ashram</p>
